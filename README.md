# TrajectFi

Trajectfi is an NFT collateralization and lending platform initially being built on the starknet ecosystem. 
It enables peer-to-peer NFT collateralization and token borrowing.

For borrowers, Trajectfi provides a protocol to get token loans with owned assets. 
All loans have fixed terms without price-based liquidation, and borrowers can renegotiate existing loans.

For lenders, Trajectfi provides a platform for generating attractive yields on owned tokens and 
also offering the chance to acquire NFTs at discounts to market price if a borrower defaults.
